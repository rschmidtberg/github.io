# Introduction

Agile project management practices alone do not acheive the primary goal of an organization's agile transformation - frequent, predictable and high quality releases of new features and issue resolutions.

This site describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline used by the RBC One program (Agile Release Train in [SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com) terminology). This CI/CD pipeline enforces quality standards to ensure that only high quality code, that meets customer requirements, can be deployed to production. Many of the steps in this pipeline are automated to ensure consistency, repeatability and minimize human error. Automated processes are also the foundation for sustainable, fast turnaround time from idea/issue identification to deployment to customers.

The logical view of the RBC One CI/CD pipeline is shown below:
